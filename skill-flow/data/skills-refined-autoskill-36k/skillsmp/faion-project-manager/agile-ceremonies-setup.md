# Agile Ceremonies Setup

## Overview

Agile ceremonies (events) provide the rhythm and structure for iterative development. This methodology covers the setup, facilitation, and optimization of Scrum events, Kanban cadences, and scaled agile ceremonies across different PM tools.

## When to Use

- Starting a new agile team
- Transitioning from waterfall to agile
- Optimizing existing ceremony effectiveness
- Scaling ceremonies for multiple teams
- Remote/hybrid team ceremony adaptation

## Process/Steps

### 1. Scrum Events Overview

```
Sprint Timeline (2 weeks):
Day 1: Sprint Planning (2-4 hrs)
├── Daily Standup (15 min) × 10 days
├── Backlog Refinement (1-2 hrs) mid-sprint
└── Day 10:
    ├── Sprint Review (1-2 hrs)
    └── Sprint Retrospective (1-2 hrs)
```

**Time Boxing:**
| Event | 1-Week Sprint | 2-Week Sprint | 4-Week Sprint |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Sprint Planning | 2 hours | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| Daily Standup | 15 minutes | 15 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Sprint Review | 1 hour | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Retrospective | 45 minutes | 1.5 hours | 3 hours |
| Refinement | 1-2 hours | 2-4 hours | 4-8 hours |

### 2. Sprint Planning

**Setup in PM Tool:**
```yaml
sprint_planning:
  preparation:
    - product_backlog_refined: true
    - sprint_goal_drafted: true
    - team_capacity_calculated: true
    - previous_velocity_reviewed: true

  agenda:
    - part_1_what: 60_minutes
      - review_sprint_goal
      - review_top_backlog_items
      - clarify_acceptance_criteria
      - team_asks_questions

    - part_2_how: 60_minutes
      - break_down_stories_to_tasks
      - estimate_tasks

      - commit_to_sprint_backlog

  outputs:
    - sprint_goal: documented
    - sprint_backlog: in_tool
    - capacity: recorded
```

**Tool Configuration:**

**Jira:**
```yaml
jira_sprint_planning:
  views:
    - backlog_view: enabled
    - sprint_planning_mode: enabled

  filters:
    - refined_stories: "status = 'Ready' AND sprint IS EMPTY"

  fields_shown:
    - story_points

### 3. Daily Standup

**Format Options:**

**Classic Three Questions:**
```
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. Any blockers?
```

**Walk-the-Board:**
```
1. Start from rightmost column (closest to done)
2. Discuss each item's status
3. Focus on flow, not individuals
4. Identify blocked items
```

**Async Standup (Remote):**
```yaml
async_standup:
  tool: slack  # or standup bot
  time: "09:00 team timezone"

  template: |
    **Yesterday:** [completed items]
    **Today:** [planned items]
    **Blockers:** [any impediments]
    **FYI:** [optional updates]

  rules:
    - post_by: "09:30"
    - thread_for_discussion: true
    - emoji_reactions_for_ack: true
```

**Tool Integration:**
```yaml
standup_automation:
  jira:
    - quick_filter: "My In Progress"
    - board_view: sprint_board
    - update_during_standup: real_time

  slack_bot:
    - geekbot: scheduled
    - standuply: scheduled
    - daily_bot: scheduled

  video:
    - zoom: 15_min_room
    - meet: recurring
    - teams: channel_meeting
```

### 4. Sprint Review (Demo)

      - demo: "Live demonstration"
      - acceptance: "Criteria met"
      - feedback: "Questions and input"
```

**PM Tool Reporting:**

```

### 6. Backlog Refinement

**Setup:**
```yaml
refinement_session:
  frequency: once_per_sprint
  duration: 1_to_2_hours
  participants:
    - product_owner: required
    - dev_team: required
    - scrum_master: facilitates

  agenda:
    - review_upcoming_items: 20_minutes
    - clarify_requirements: 30_minutes
    - break_down_large_items: 20_minutes
    - estimate_items: 20_minutes
    - prioritize: 10_minutes

  definition_of_ready:
    - acceptance_criteria_defined: true
    - dependencies_identified: true
    - estimate_provided: true
    - small_enough: true  # fits in sprint
    - testable: true
```

**Estimation Techniques:**

**Planning Poker:**
```yaml
planning_poker:
  scale: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, "?", "☕"]
  tools:
    - planningpoker.com
    - scrumpoker-online.org
    - integrated_in_jira

  process:
    1. PO presents story
    2. Team asks questions
    3. Everyone votes secretly
    4. Reveal simultaneously
    5. Discuss outliers
    6. Re-vote if needed
    7. Consensus recorded
```

```
| Size | Relative Effort | Story Points |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| XS | Very small, few hours | 1 |
| S | Small, ~1 day | 2-3 |

## Best Practices

### General Principles
1. **Time-box strictly** - End on time, always
2. **Prepare in advance** - Agendas, data, environment
3. **Focus on outcomes** - Not just going through motions
4. **Rotate facilitation** - Build team capability

### Remote Ceremonies
1. **Cameras on** - Increases engagement
2. **Async prep** - Share materials beforehand
3. **Interactive tools** - Miro, FigJam, digital boards
4. **Shorter sessions** - Zoom fatigue is real
5. **Record for absent** - Respect time zones

### Tool Integration
1. **Single source of truth** - Use PM tool during ceremonies
2. **Real-time updates** - Update board during standup
3. **Automated reporting** - Dashboards for reviews
4. **Action item tracking** - Retro actions in backlog

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Measure effectiveness** - Ceremony health surveys
2. **Experiment** - Try new formats
3. **Adapt to team** - No one-size-fits-all
4. **Regular meta-retros** - Retrospective on retrospectives
