# remove subcommand

Remove worktrees and delete their associated branches.

## Usage

```txt
twig remove <branch>... [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `<branch>...`: One or more branch names to remove (required)

## Flags

| Flag        | Short | Description                                         |
|-------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--force`   | `-f`  | Force removal (can be specified twice, see below)   |
| `--check`   |       | Show removal eligibility without making changes     |
| `--verbose` | `-v`  | Enable verbose output (use `-vv` for debug logging) |

## Behavior

- Finds the worktree path by looking up the branch name
- Prevents removal if current directory is inside the target worktree
- Cleans up empty parent directories after removal (see below)
- With `--check`: prints what would be removed without making changes
- Without `--force`: fails if there are uncommitted changes,
  submodules have uncommitted changes, the branch is not merged,
  or the worktree is locked
- With `-f` (once): bypasses uncommitted changes, dirty submodule,
  and unmerged branch checks
- With `-ff` (twice): also bypasses locked worktree checks

This matches git's behavior where `git worktree remove -f` removes unclean
worktrees and `git worktree remove -f -f` also removes locked worktrees.

### Submodule Handling

`git worktree remove` requires `--force` for any worktree containing initialized
submodules, even when submodules are clean. twig improves this behavior:

- **Clean submodules**: Removed automatically without requiring `--force`.
  twig detects that submodules have no uncommitted changes and handles the
  removal safely.
- **Dirty submodules**: Fails with "submodule has uncommitted changes".
  Use `--force` to remove anyway.

### Prunable Worktrees

When a worktree directory is deleted externally (via `rm -rf` or other means),
the branch remains but the worktree becomes "prunable". The remove command
handles this gracefully:

```bash
# Worktree deleted externally
rm -rf /path/to/feat/x

# twig remove still works - prunes the stale record and deletes the branch
twig remove feat/x
```

For prunable worktrees:

- Stale worktree records are pruned automatically
- Branch is deleted as usual
- No cwd check is performed (directory doesn't exist)
- `--check` shows "Would prune stale worktree record"

### Upstream Gone Branches

Branches whose remote tracking branch has been deleted are detected as
"upstream gone" and removed without requiring `--force`.

### Empty Directory Cleanup

After removing a worktree, twig automatically removes any empty parent
directories up to `WorktreeDestBaseDir`. This prevents orphan directories
from blocking future branch creation.

Example:

```txt
# Remove feat/test worktree
twig remove feat/test

# If feat/ directory is now empty, it is also removed
# This allows creating a 'feat' branch later
```

The cleanup is safe:

- Only removes empty directories
- Stops at `WorktreeDestBaseDir` boundary
- Preserves directories containing other worktrees or files
- Cleanup errors are non-fatal (main operation succeeds)

### Verbose Output

With `--verbose`, additional information is displayed:

- With `--check`: shows the list of uncommitted changes in the worktree
- On failure due to uncommitted changes: shows the list of changed files

Example with `--check --verbose`:

```txt
twig remove feat/test --check -v
Would remove worktree: /path/to/feat/test
Uncommitted changes:
   M src/main.go
  A  src/new.go
  ?? tmp/debug.log
Would delete branch: feat/test
```

Example on failure with `--verbose`:

```txt
twig remove feat/test -v
error: feat/test: cannot remove: has uncommitted changes
Uncommitted changes:
   M src/main.go
  ?? tmp/debug.log
hint: use 'twig remove --force' to force removal
```

The status codes follow git status --porcelain format:

| Code | Meaning              |
|------|----------------------|
| `M` | Modified (unstaged)  |
| `M` | Modified (staged)    |
| `A` | Added (staged)       |
| `??` | Untracked            |

### Output Modes

By default, successful removal produces no output (silent mode).
Use `--verbose` to see detailed output:

```txt
# Default: silent on success
twig remove feat/test

# Verbose: shows what was removed
twig remove feat/test -v
Removed worktree and branch: feat/test
```

### Debug Output

With `-vv`, debug logging is enabled to trace internal operations:

```txt
# Debug output (shows internal operation traces)
twig remove feat/test -vv
2026-01-18 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] remove: checking branch=feat/test path=/path/to/feat/test
2026-01-18 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] remove: check completed canRemove=true branch=feat/test
Removed worktree and branch: feat/test
```

## Multiple Branches

When multiple branches are specified, errors on individual branches
do not stop processing of remaining branches. All results and errors
are reported at the end.

```txt
# Remove multiple worktrees
twig remove feature/a feature/b feature/c
```

## Exit Code

- 0: All branches removed successfully
- 1: One or more branches failed to remove
