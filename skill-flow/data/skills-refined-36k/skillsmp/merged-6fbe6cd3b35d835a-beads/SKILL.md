# Beads

## Overview

`bd` is a graph-based issue tracker designed for persistent memory across sessions. It is suitable for multi-session work with complex dependencies, while `TodoWrite` is recommended for simple single-session tasks.

## When to Use `bd` vs `TodoWrite`

### Use `bd` when:
- **Multi-session work**: Tasks spanning multiple compaction cycles or days.
- **Complex dependencies**: Work with blockers, prerequisites, or hierarchical structures.
- **Knowledge work**: Strategic documents, research, or tasks with fuzzy boundaries.
- **Side quests**: Exploratory work that might pause the main task.
- **Project memory**: Need to resume work after weeks away with full context.

### Use `TodoWrite` when:
- **Single-session tasks**: Work that completes within the current session.
- **Linear execution**: Straightforward step-by-step tasks with no branching.
- **Immediate context**: All information already in conversation.
- **Simple tracking**: Just need a checklist to show progress.

**Key insight**: If resuming work after 2 weeks would be difficult without `bd`, use `bd`. If the work can be picked up from a markdown skim, `TodoWrite` is sufficient.

### Test Yourself: `bd` or `TodoWrite`?

Ask these questions to decide:

**Choose `bd` if:**
- ❓ "Will I need this context in 2 weeks?" → Yes = `bd`
- ❓ "Could conversation history get compacted?" → Yes = `bd`
- ❓ "Does this have blockers/dependencies?" → Yes = `bd`
- ❓ "Is this fuzzy/exploratory work?" → Yes = `bd`

**Choose `TodoWrite` if:**
- ❓ "Will this be done in this session?" → Yes = `TodoWrite`
- ❓ "Is this just a task list for me right now?" → Yes = `TodoWrite`
- ❓ "Is this linear with no branching?" → Yes = `TodoWrite`

**When in doubt**: Use `bd`. Better to have persistent memory you don't need than to lose context you needed.

## Surviving Compaction Events

**Critical**: Compaction events delete conversation history but preserve `bd`. After compaction, `bd` state is your only persistent memory.

**What survives compaction:**
- All bead data (issues, notes, dependencies, status)
- Complete work history and context

**What doesn't survive:**
- Conversation history
- `TodoWrite` lists
- Recent discussion context

**Writing notes for post-compaction recovery:**

Write notes as if explaining to a future agent with zero conversation context:

**Pattern:**
```markdown
notes field format:
- COMPLETED: Specific deliverables ("implemented JWT refresh endpoint + rate limiting")
- IN PROGRESS: Current state + next immediate step ("testing password reset flow, need user input on email template")
- BLOCKERS: What's preventing progress
- KEY DECISIONS: Important context or user guidance
```

**After compaction:** `bd show <issue-id>` reconstructs full context from notes field.

### Notes Quality Self-Check

Before checkpointing (especially pre-compaction), verify your notes pass these tests:

❓ **Future-me test**: "Could I resume this work in 2 weeks with zero conversation history?"
- [ ] What was completed? (Specific deliverables, not "made progress")
- [ ] What's in progress? (Current state + immediate next step)
- [ ] What's blocked? (Specific blockers with context)
- [ ] What decisions were made? (Why, not just what)

❓ **Stranger test**: "Could another developer understand this without asking me?"
- [ ] Technical choices explained (not just stated)
- [ ] Trade-offs documented (why this approach vs alternatives)
- [ ] User input captured (decisions that came from discussion)

**Good note example:**
```
COMPLETED: JWT auth with RS256 (1hr access, 7d refresh tokens)
KEY DECISION: RS256 over HS256 per security review - enables key rotation
IN PROGRESS: Password reset flow - email service working, need rate limiting
BLOCKERS: Waiting on user decision: reset token expiry (15min vs 1hr trade-off)
NEXT: Implement rate limiting (5 attempts/15min) once expiry decided
```

**Bad note example:**
```
Working on auth. Made some progress. More to do.
```

## Session Start Protocol

**`bd` is available when:**
- Project has a `.beads/` directory (project-local database), OR
- `~/.beads/` exists (global fallback database for any directory)

**At session start, always check for `bd` availability and run ready check.**

### Session Start Checklist

Copy this checklist when starting any session where `bd` is available:

```
Session Start:
- [ ] Run bd ready --json to see available work
- [ ] Run bd list --status in_progress --json for active work
- [ ] If in_progress exists: bd show <issue-id> to read notes
- [ ] Report context to user: "X items ready: [summary]"
- [ ] If using global ~/.beads, mention this in report
- [ ] If nothing ready: bd blocked --json to check blockers
```

**Pattern**: Always check both `bd ready` AND `bd list --status in_progress`. Read notes field first to understand where previous session left off.

**Report format**:
- "I can see X items ready to work on: [summary]"
- "Issue Y is in_progress. Last session: [summary from notes]. Next: [from notes]. Should I continue with that?"

This establishes immediate shared context about available and active work without requiring user prompting.

### When No Work is Ready

If `bd ready` returns empty but issues exist:

```bash
bd blocked --json
```

Report blockers and suggest next steps.

## Progress Checkpointing

Update `bd` notes at these checkpoints (don't wait for session end):

**Critical triggers:**
- ⚠️ **Context running low** - User says "running out of context" / "approaching compaction" / "close to token limit"
- 📊 **Token budget > 70%** - Proactively checkpoint when approaching limits
- 🎯 **Major milestone reached** - Completed significant piece of work
- 🚧 **Hit a blocker** - Can't proceed, need to capture what was tried
- 🔄 **Task transition** - Switching issues or about to close this one
- ❓ **Before user input** - About to ask decision that might change direction

**Proactive monitoring during session:**
- At 70% token usage: "We're at 70% token usage - good time to checkpoint `bd` notes?"
- At 85% token usage: "Approaching token limit (85%) - checkpointing current state to `bd`"
- At 90% token usage: Automatically checkpoint without asking

**Checkpoint checklist:**

```
Progress Checkpoint:
- [ ] Update notes with COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/NEXT format
- [ ] Document KEY DECISIONS or BLOCKERS since last update
- [ ] Mark current status (in_progress/blocked/closed)
- [ ] If discovered new work: create issues with discovered-from
- [ ] Verify notes are self-explanatory for post-compaction resume
```

**Most important**: When user says "running out of context" OR when you see >70% token usage - checkpoint immediately, even if mid-task.

## Database Selection

`bd` automatically selects the appropriate database:
- **Project-local** (`.beads/` in project): Used for project-specific work.
- **Global fallback** (`~/.beads/`): Used when no project-local database exists.

**Use case for global database**: Cross-project tracking, personal task management, knowledge work that doesn't belong to a specific project.

**When to use --db flag explicitly:**
- Accessing a specific database outside current directory.
- Working with multiple databases (e.g., project database + reference database).
- Example: `bd --db /path/to/reference/terms.db list`.

## Core Operations

All `bd` commands support `--json` flag for structured output when needed for programmatic parsing.

### Essential Operations

**Check ready work:**
```bash
bd ready
bd ready --json              # For structured output
bd ready --priority 0        # Filter by priority
bd ready --assignee alice    # Filter by assignee
```

**Create new issue:**

**IMPORTANT**: Always quote title and description arguments with double quotes, especially when containing spaces or special characters.

```bash
bd create "Fix login bug"
bd create "Add OAuth" -p 0 -t feature
bd create "Write tests" -d "Unit tests for auth module" --assignee alice
bd create "Research caching" --design "Evaluate Redis vs Memcached"

# Examples with special characters (requires quoting):
bd create "Fix: auth doesn't handle edge cases" -p 1
bd create "Refactor auth module" -d "Split auth.go into separate files (handlers, middleware, utils)"
```

**Update issue status:**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
bd update issue-123 --priority 0
bd update issue-123 --assignee bob
bd update issue-123 --design "Decided to use Redis for persistence support"
```

**Close completed work:**
```bash
bd close issue-123
bd close issue-123 --reason "Implemented in PR #42"
bd close issue-1 issue-2 issue-3 --reason "Bulk close related work"
```

**Show issue details:**
```bash
bd show issue-123
bd show issue-123 --json
```

**List issues:**
```bash
bd list
bd list --status open
bd list --priority 0
bd list --type bug
bd list --assignee alice
```

## Field Usage Reference

Quick guide for when and how to use each `bd` field:

| Field                   | Purpose                                          | When to Set          | Update Frequency                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **description**         | Immutable problem statement                      | At creation          | Never (fixed forever)             |
| **design**              | Initial approach, architecture, decisions        | During planning      | Rarely (only if approach changes) |
| **acceptance-criteria** | Concrete deliverables checklist (`- [ ]` syntax) | When design is clear | Mark `- [x]` as items complete    |
| **notes**               | Session handoff (COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/NEXT)     | During work          | At session end, major milestones  |
| **status**              | Workflow state (open→in_progress→closed)         | As work progresses   | When changing phases              |
| **priority**            | Urgency level (0=highest, 3=lowest)              | At creation          | Adjust if priorities shift        |

## Issue Lifecycle Workflow

### 1. Discovery Phase (Proactive Issue Creation)

**During exploration or implementation, proactively file issues for:**
- Bugs or problems discovered
- Potential improvements noticed
- Follow-up work identified
- Technical debt encountered
- Questions requiring research

**Pattern:**
```bash
# When encountering new work during a task:
bd create "Found: auth doesn't handle profile permissions"
bd dep add current-task-id new-issue-id --type discovered-from

# Continue with original task - issue persists for later
```

### 2. Execution Phase (Status Maintenance)

**Mark issues in_progress when starting work:**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
```

**Update throughout work:**
```bash
# Add design notes as implementation progresses
bd update issue-123 --design "Using JWT with RS256 algorithm"

# Update acceptance criteria if requirements clarify
bd update issue-123 --acceptance "- JWT validation works\n- Tests pass\n- Error handling returns 401"
```

**Close when complete:**
```bash
bd close issue-123 --reason "Implemented JWT validation with tests passing"
```

### 3. Planning Phase (Dependency Graphs)

For complex multi-step work, structure issues with dependencies before starting:

**Create parent epic:**
```bash
bd create "Implement user authentication" -t epic -d "OAuth integration with JWT tokens"
```

**Create subtasks:**
```bash
bd create "Set up OAuth credentials" -t task
bd create "Implement authorization flow" -t task
bd create "Add token refresh" -t task
```

**Link with dependencies:**
```bash
# parent-child for epic structure
bd dep add auth-epic auth-setup --type parent-child
bd dep add auth-epic auth-flow --type parent-child

# blocks for ordering
bd dep add auth-setup auth-flow
```

## Dependency Types Reference

`bd` supports four dependency types:

1. **blocks** - Hard blocker (issue A blocks issue B from starting)
2. **related** - Soft link (issues are related but not blocking)
3. **parent-child** - Hierarchical (epic/subtask relationship)
4. **discovered-from** - Provenance (issue B discovered while working on A)

## Integration with TodoWrite

**Both tools complement each other at different timescales:**

### Temporal Layering Pattern

**TodoWrite** (short-term working memory - this hour):
- Tactical execution: "Review Section 3", "Expand Q&A answers"
- Marked completed as you go
- Present/future tense ("Review", "Expand", "Create")
- Ephemeral: Disappears when session ends

**Beads** (long-term episodic memory - this week/month):
- Strategic objectives: "Continue work on strategic planning document"
- Key decisions and outcomes in notes field
- Past tense in notes ("COMPLETED", "Discovered", "Blocked by")
- Persistent: Survives compaction and session boundaries

### The Handoff Pattern

1. **Session start**: Read bead → Create TodoWrite items for immediate actions
2. **During work**: Mark TodoWrite items completed as you go
3. **Reach milestone**: Update bead notes with outcomes + context
4. **Session end**: TodoWrite disappears, bead survives with enriched notes

**After compaction**: TodoWrite is gone forever, but bead notes reconstruct what happened.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Knowledge Work Session

**Scenario**: User asks "Help me write a proposal for expanding the analytics platform"

**What you see**:
```bash
$ bd ready
# Returns: bd-42 "Research analytics platform expansion proposal" (in_progress)

$ bd show bd-42
Notes: "COMPLETED: Reviewed current stack (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
IN PROGRESS: Drafting cost-benefit analysis section
NEXT: Need user input on budget constraints before finalizing recommendations"
```

**What you do**:
1. Read notes to understand current state
2. Create TodoWrite for immediate work:
   ```
   - [ ] Draft cost-benefit analysis
   - [ ] Ask user about budget constraints
   - [ ] Finalize recommendations
   ```
3. Work on tasks, mark TodoWrite items completed
4. At milestone, update `bd` notes:
   ```bash
   bd update bd-42 --notes "COMPLETED: Cost-benefit analysis drafted.
   KEY DECISION: User confirmed $50k budget cap - ruled out enterprise options.
   IN PROGRESS: Finalizing recommendations (Posthog + custom ETL).
   NEXT: Get user review of draft before closing issue."
   ```

**Outcome**: TodoWrite disappears at session end, but `bd` notes preserve context for next session.

### Pattern 2: Side Quest Handling

During main task, discover a problem:
1. Create issue: `bd create "Found: inventory system needs refactoring"`
2. Link using discovered-from: `bd dep add main-task new-issue --type discovered-from`
3. Assess: blocker or can defer?
4. If blocker: `bd update main-task --status blocked`, work on new issue
5. If deferrable: note in issue, continue main task

### Pattern 3: Multi-Session Project Resume
