# Testing Standards

## **Priority: P1 (HIGH)**

Ensuring code reliability through multi-layered testing strategies.

## Structure

```text
test/
├── unit/ # Business logic & mapping (Blocs, Repositories, UseCases)
├── widget/ # UI component behavior (Screens, Widgets)
└── integration/ # End-to-end flows
```

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Testing Pyramid**: Maintain ~70% Unit Tests, ~20% Widget Tests, ~10% Integration Tests.
- **Mocks**: Use `mocktail` for type-safe, boilerplate-free mocking.
- **Unit Tests**: Test logic in isolation. Verify all edge cases (Success, Failure, Exception).
- **Widget Tests**: Test high-value interactions (Button clicks, Error states, Loading indicators).
- **BLoC Tests**: Use `blocTest` to verify state emission sequences.
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage on Domain and Presentation (Logic) layers.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- **Thread Sleep**: `**No Future.delayed**: Use FakeAsync or expectations for deterministic timing.`
- **Missing Assertions**: `**No "Execution Only" Tests**: A test without an expect() call is invalid.`
- **Over-Mocking**: `**No Mocking Data Classes**: Use real instances for Entities/Models; mock only I/O.`
- **Test Pollution**: `**No Shared State**: Ensure every test is Independent (FIRST).`
