# /sdlc-studio epic - Epics

## Quick Reference

```
/sdlc-studio epic                   # Generate Epics from PRD
/sdlc-studio epic review            # Review Epic status
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004      # Preview workflow for all stories
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 # Execute workflow for all stories
```

## Prerequisites

- PRD must exist at `sdlc-studio/prd.md`
- Run `/sdlc-studio prd` first if missing

## Actions

### generate (default)
Parse PRD and group features into Epics.

**What happens:**
1. Reads Feature Inventory from PRD
2. Groups related features (5-8 per Epic)
3. Creates Epic files with business context, scope, acceptance criteria
4. Creates `sdlc-studio/epics/_index.md` registry

**Grouping heuristics:**
- Features sharing same user type → same Epic
- Features with shared dependencies → same Epic
- Features forming complete user journey → same Epic

### review
Review Epic status based on Stories and codebase.

**What happens:**
1. Reads all Epics and their linked Stories
2. Calculates completion from Story status
3. Verifies against codebase implementation
4. Updates status and acceptance criteria checkboxes

## Output

**Files:**
- `sdlc-studio/epics/EP{NNNN}-{slug}.md` per Epic
- `sdlc-studio/epics/_index.md` registry

**Status values:** Draft | Ready | Approved | In Progress | Done

**Status rules:**
- New epics start as "Draft"
- `epic review` suggests "Done" when all stories complete, but user confirms

> **Source of truth:** `reference-decisions.md` → Status Transition Rules

**Epic sections:**
- Summary
- Business Context (problem, value, metrics)
- Scope (in/out, affected personas)
- Acceptance Criteria
- Dependencies
- Risks & Assumptions
- Technical Considerations
- Sizing & Effort
- Story Breakdown
- Test Plan link

## Examples

```
# Generate all Epics from PRD
/sdlc-studio epic

# Review Epic status after Stories complete
/sdlc-studio epic review

# Use custom PRD location
/sdlc-studio epic --prd ./docs/requirements.md
```

## Next Steps

After generating Epics:
```
/sdlc-studio story                # Generate Stories from Epics
/sdlc-studio test-plan            # Generate Test Plans for Epics
```

## Naming Convention

- ID format: `EP0001`, `EP0002`, etc. (global numbering)
- Slug: kebab-case from title, max 50 chars
- Example: `EP0001-user-authentication.md`

## Workflow Commands

Automate the full implementation workflow for all stories in an epic.

### plan

Preview the implementation workflow for all stories in an epic.

```
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004
```

**What happens:**
1. Lists all stories in epic with status
2. Filters to stories that need implementation (Ready, not Done)
3. Analyses cross-story dependencies
4. Determines execution order (topological sort)
5. Shows aggregate work preview

**Output:**
```
## Epic Workflow Plan: EP0004

**Epic:** Agent Execution Engine
**Stories:** 8 total (3 Done, 5 Ready)

### Execution Order

| Order | Story | Title | Dependencies | Approach |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | US0023 | Config Schema | None | TDD |
| 2 | US0024 | Action Queue API | US0023 | TDD |
| 3 | US0025 | Script Parser | US0023 | TDD |
| 4 | US0026 | Action Executor | US0024, US0025 | TDD |
| 5 | US0027 | Agent Runner | US0026 | Test-After |

### Summary
- **Stories to implement:** 5
- **TDD stories:** 4
- **Test-After stories:** 1
- **Estimated phases:** 35 (7 per story)

### Dependency Graph
US0023 --+-- US0024 --+-- US0026 -- US0027
         +-- US0025 --+

Ready to execute? Run: /sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004
```

### implement

Execute the full implementation workflow for all stories in an epic.

```
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --skip US0025
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--epic EP000X` | Target epic (required) |
| `--story US000X` | Start from specific story |
| `--skip US000X` | Skip specific story |

**What happens:**
1. Loads or creates epic workflow plan
2. Processes stories in dependency order
3. Runs `story implement` for each story
4. Tracks overall progress
5. Pauses on story failure with resume capability
6. Updates epic status on completion

**State tracking:**
Creates `sdlc-studio/workflows/WF{NNNN}-{epic-slug}.md` to track progress.

**Story execution:**

For each story in dependency order:
1. Check dependencies are Done
2. Run `story implement --story US000X`
3. On success: mark story Done, continue to next
4. On failure: pause epic workflow, save state

**Resume after pause:**
```
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
```
