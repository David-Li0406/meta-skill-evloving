# Plotly

Python graphing library for creating interactive, publication-quality visualizations with 40+ chart types.

## Quick Start

Install Plotly:
```bash
uv pip install plotly
```

Basic usage with Plotly Express (high-level API):
```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'y': [10, 11, 12, 13]
})

fig = px.scatter(df, x='x', y='y', title='My First Plot')
fig.show()
```

## Choosing Between APIs

### Use Plotly Express (px)
For quick, standard visualizations with sensible defaults:
- Working with pandas DataFrames
- Creating common chart types (scatter, line, bar, histogram, etc.)
- Need automatic color encoding and legends
- Want minimal code (1-5 lines)

### Use Graph Objects (go)
For fine-grained control and custom visualizations:
- Chart types not in Plotly Express (3D mesh, isosurface, complex financial charts)
- Building complex multi-trace figures from scratch
- Need precise control over individual components
- Creating specialized visualizations with custom shapes and annotations

**Note:** Plotly Express returns graph objects Figure, so you can combine approaches:
```python
fig = px.scatter(df, x='x', y='y')
fig.update_layout(title='Custom Title')  # Use go methods on px figure
fig.add_hline(y=10)                     # Add shapes
```

## Core Capabilities

Plotly supports 40+ chart types organized into categories:

**Basic Charts:** scatter, line, bar, pie, area, bubble

**Statistical Charts:** histogram, box plot, violin, distribution, error bars

**Scientific Charts:** heatmap, contour, ternary, image display

**Financial Charts:** candlestick, OHLC, waterfall, funnel, time series

**Maps:** scatter maps, choropleth, density maps (geographic visualization)

**3D Charts:** scatter3d, surface, mesh, cone, volume

**Specialized:** sunburst, treemap, sankey, parallel coordinates, gauge

For detailed examples and usage of all chart types, refer to the official Plotly documentation.
