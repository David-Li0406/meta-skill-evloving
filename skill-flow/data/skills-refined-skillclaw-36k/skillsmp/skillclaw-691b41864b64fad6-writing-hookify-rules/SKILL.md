# Writing Hookify Rules

## Overview

Hookify rules are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define patterns to watch for and messages to show when those patterns match. Rules are stored in `.claude/hookify.{rule-name}.local.md` files.

## Rule File Format

### Basic Structure

```markdown
---
name: rule-identifier
enabled: true
event: bash|file|stop|prompt|all
pattern: regex-pattern-here
---

Message to show Claude when this rule triggers.
Can include markdown formatting, warnings, suggestions, etc.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

**name** (required): Unique identifier for the rule
- Use kebab-case: `warn-dangerous-rm`, `block-console-log`
- Be descriptive and action-oriented
- Start with a verb: warn, prevent, block, require, check

**enabled** (required): Boolean to activate/deactivate
- `true`: Rule is active
- `false`: Rule is disabled (won't trigger)
- Can toggle without deleting the rule

**event** (required): Which hook event to trigger on
- `bash`: Bash tool commands
- `file`: Edit, Write, MultiEdit tools
- `stop`: When the agent wants to stop
- `prompt`: When the user submits a prompt
- `all`: All events

**action** (optional): What to do when the rule matches
- `warn`: Show message but allow operation (default)
- `block`: Prevent operation (PreToolUse) or stop session (Stop events)
- If omitted, defaults to `warn`

**pattern** (simple format): Regex pattern to match
- Used for simple single-condition rules
- Matches against command (bash) or new_text (file)
- Python regex syntax

**Example:**
```yaml
event: bash
pattern: rm\s+-rf
```

### Advanced Format (Multiple Conditions)

For complex rules with multiple conditions:

```markdown
---
name: warn-env-file-edits
enabled: true
event: file
conditions:
  - field: file_path
    operator: regex_match
    pattern: \.env$
  - field: new_text
    operator: contains
    pattern: API_KEY
---

You're adding an API key to a .env file. Ensure this file is in .gitignore!
```

**Condition fields:**
- `field`: Which field to check
  - For bash: `command`
  - For file: `file_path`, `new_text`, `old_text`, `content`
- `operator`: How to match
  - `regex_match`: Regex pattern matching
  - `contains`: Substring check
  - `equals`: Exact match
  - `not_contains`: Substring must NOT
