# CLAUDE.md Improver

Audit, evaluate, and improve CLAUDE.md files across a codebase to ensure Claude Code has optimal project context.

**This skill can write to CLAUDE.md files.** After presenting a quality report and getting user approval, it updates CLAUDE.md files with targeted improvements.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

Find all CLAUDE.md files in the repository:

```bash
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name ".claude.md" -o -name ".claude.local.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**File Types & Locations:**

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Project root | `./CLAUDE.md` | Primary project context (checked into git, shared with team) |
| Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal/local settings (gitignored, not shared) |
| Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults across all projects |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module-level context in monorepos |
| Subdirectory | Any nested location | Feature/domain-specific context |

**Note:** Claude auto-discovers CLAUDE.md files in parent directories, making monorepo setups work automatically.

### Phase 2: Quality Assessment

For each CLAUDE.md file, evaluate against quality criteria. See [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for detailed rubrics.

**Quick Assessment Checklist:**

| Criterion | Weight | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Commands/workflows documented | High | Are build/test/deploy commands present? |
| Architecture clarity | High | Can Claude understand the codebase structure? |
| Non-obvious patterns | Medium | Are gotchas and quirks documented? |
| Conciseness | Medium | No verbose explanations or obvious info? |
| Currency | High | Does it reflect current codebase state? |
| Actionability | High | Are instructions executable, not vague? |

**Quality Scores:**
- **A (90-100)**: Comprehensive, current, actionable
- **B (70-89)**: Good coverage, minor gaps
- **C (50-69)**: Basic info, missing key sections
- **D (30-49)**: Sparse or outdated
- **F (0-29)**: Missing or severely lacking
