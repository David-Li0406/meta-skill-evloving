# /crypto-market Command

Quick market status summary using key on-chain metrics.

## Usage

```
/crypto-market          # Bitcoin (default)
/crypto-market btc      # Bitcoin
/crypto-market eth      # Ethereum
```

## Workflow

```
1. Ensure session initialized (call initialize() if needed)

2. Query metrics in PARALLEL:
   - MVRV: /v1/{asset}/market-indicator/mvrv (window: day, limit: 1)
   - SOPR: /v1/{asset}/market-indicator/sopr (window: day, limit: 1)
   - Netflow: /v1/{asset}/exchange-flows/netflow (window: day, limit: 1, exchange: all_exchange)
   - Reserve: /v1/{asset}/exchange-flows/reserve (window: day, limit: 7, exchange: all_exchange)

3. Interpret using thresholds below

4. Generate combined signal
```

## Interpretation Thresholds

| Metric | Bullish | Neutral | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| MVRV | < 1.0 | 1.0 - 2.5 | > 3.5 |
| SOPR | < 0.95 | 0.95 - 1.05 | > 1.10 |
| Netflow | < -1,000 BTC | ±1,000 | > +5,000 BTC |
| Reserve (7d) | Declining | Stable | Rising |

## Output Format

```
## BTC Market Summary

| Metric | Value | Signal |
|--------|-------|--------|
| MVRV | 2.14 | Neutral |
| SOPR | 1.02 | Neutral |
| Netflow | -2,450 BTC | Bullish |
| Reserve | -12.5K (7d) | Bullish |

**Overall**: Slightly Bullish

Key insight: Exchange outflows suggest accumulation.
```

## Signal Logic

| Condition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| 4/4 bullish | Bullish |
| 3/4 bullish | Slightly Bullish |
| 2/2 each way | Neutral |
| 3/4 bearish | Slightly Bearish |
| 4/4 bearish | Bearish |
