# Skill body

## Purpose

Execute comprehensive network traffic analysis using Wireshark to capture, filter, and examine network packets for security investigations, performance optimization, and troubleshooting. This skill enables systematic analysis of network protocols, detection of anomalies, and reconstruction of network conversations from PCAP files.

## Inputs / Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Wireshark installed (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Network interface with capture permissions
- PCAP/PCAPNG files for offline analysis
- Administrator/root privileges for live capture

### Technical Requirements
- Understanding of network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS)
- Familiarity with IP addressing and ports
- Knowledge of OSI model layers
- Understanding of common attack patterns

### Use Cases
- Network troubleshooting and connectivity issues
- Security incident investigation
- Malware traffic analysis
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Protocol learning and education

## Outputs / Deliverables

### Primary Outputs
- Filtered packet captures for specific traffic
- Reconstructed communication streams
- Traffic statistics and visualizations
- Evidence documentation for incidents

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Capturing Network Traffic

#### Start Live Capture
Begin capturing packets on network interface:

```
1. Launch Wireshark
2. Select network interface from main screen
3. Click shark fin icon or double-click interface
4. Capture begins immediately
```

#### Capture Controls
| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Start/Stop Capture | Ctrl+E | Toggle capture on/off |
| Restart Capture | Ctrl+R | Stop and start new capture |
| Open PCAP File | Ctrl+O | Load existing capture file |
| Save Capture | Ctrl+S | Save current capture |

#### Capture Filters
Apply filters before capture to limit data collection:

```
# Capture only specific host
host 192.168.1.100

# Capture specific port
port 80

# Capture specific network
net 192.168.1.0/24
```
