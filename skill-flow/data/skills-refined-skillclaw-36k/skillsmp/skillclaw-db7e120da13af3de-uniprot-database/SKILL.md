# Skill body

## Overview

UniProt is the world's leading comprehensive protein sequence and functional information resource. This skill allows you to search proteins by name, gene, or accession, retrieve sequences in FASTA format, perform ID mapping across databases, and access Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL annotations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Searching for protein entries by name, gene symbol, accession, or organism
- Retrieving protein sequences in FASTA or other formats
- Mapping identifiers between UniProt and external databases (Ensembl, RefSeq, PDB, etc.)
- Accessing protein annotations including GO terms, domains, and functional descriptions
- Batch retrieving multiple protein entries efficiently
- Querying reviewed (Swiss-Prot) vs. unreviewed (TrEMBL) protein data
- Streaming large protein datasets
- Building custom queries with field-specific search syntax

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Searching for Proteins

Search UniProt using natural language queries or structured search syntax.

**Common search patterns:**
```python
# Search by protein name
query = "insulin AND organism_name:\"Homo sapiens\""

# Search by gene name
query = "gene:BRCA1 AND reviewed:true"

# Search by accession
query = "accession:P12345"

# Search by sequence length
query = "length:[100 TO 500]"

# Search by taxonomy
query = "taxonomy_id:9606"  # Human proteins

# Search by GO term
query = "go:0005515"  # Protein binding
```

Use the API search endpoint: `https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query={query}&format={format}`

**Supported formats:** JSON, TSV, Excel, XML, FASTA, RDF, TXT

### 2. Retrieving Individual Protein Entries

Retrieve specific protein entries by accession number.

**Accession number formats:**
- Classic: P12345, Q1AAA9, O15530 (6 characters: letter + 5 alphanumeric)
- Extended: A0A022YWF9 (10 characters for newer entries)

**Retrieve endpoint:** `https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/{accession}.{format}`

Example: `https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P12345.fasta`

### 3. Batch Retrieval and ID Mapping

Map protein identifiers between different database systems and retrieve multiple entries efficiently.

**ID Mapping Endpoint:** `https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/idmapping`

**Example of ID mapping request:**
```python
# Example of mapping UniProt IDs to another database
mapping_query = "from=UniProtKB&to=Ensembl&ids=P12345"
```
