description: Use this skill when you need capabilities that your current model lacks, such as image generation or real-time data from X/Twitter, or when explicitly requested by the user.

# BlockRun

**BlockRun works with Claude Code and Google Antigravity.**

You can't generate images or access real-time X/Twitter data. BlockRun provides these capabilities.

## Philosophy

You have a wallet. When you need a capability you lack, you pay for it autonomously.

| You Need | You Call | Pricing |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Image generation | DALL-E | $0.04/image |
| Real-time X data | Grok + Live Search | $0.025/source |
| Second opinion | GPT-5.2 | $1.75/M input, $14/M output |
| Cheaper processing | DeepSeek | $0.14/M input, $0.28/M output |

**How it works:** BlockRun uses x402 micropayments to route your requests to OpenAI, xAI, Google, and other providers. No API keys needed - your wallet pays per token.

## Budget Control (Optional)

If the user specifies a budget (e.g., "use at most $1"), track spending and stop when the budget is reached:

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
budget = 1.0  # User's budget

# Before each call, check if within budget
spending = client.get_spending()
if spending['total_usd'] >= budget:
    print(f"Budget reached: ${spending['total_usd']:.4f} spent")
    # Stop making calls
else:
    response = client.chat("openai/gpt-5.2", "Hello!")

# At the end, report spending
spending = client.get_spending()
print(f"💰 Total spent: ${spending['total_usd']:.4f} across {spending['calls']} calls")
```

## When to Use

| Trigger | Your Action |
|---------|-------------|
| User explicitly requests ("blockrun second opinion with GPT on...", "use grok to check...", "generate image with dall-e") | Execute via BlockRun |
| User needs something you can't do (images, live X data) | Suggest BlockRun, wait for confirmation |
| You can handle the task fine | Do it yourself, don't mention BlockRun |

## Example User Prompts

Users will say things like:

| User Says | What You Do |
|-----------|-------------|
| "blockrun generate an image of a sunset" | Call DALL-E via ImageClient |
| "use grok to check what's trending on X" | Call Grok with `search=True` |
| "blockrun GPT review this code" | Call GPT-5.2 via LLMClient |
| "what's the latest news about AI agents?" | Suggest Grok for real-time updates |
