# Database Schema Designer

Design production-ready database schemas with best practices built-in.

## Quick Start

Just describe your data model:

```
design a schema for an e-commerce platform with users, products, orders
```

You'll get a complete SQL schema like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  INDEX idx_orders_user (user_id)
);
```

**What to include in your request:**
- Entities (users, products, orders)
- Key relationships (users have orders, orders have items)
- Scale hints (high-traffic, millions of records)
- Database preference (SQL/NoSQL) - defaults to SQL if not specified

## Triggers

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `design schema` | "design a schema for user authentication" |
| `database design` | "database design for multi-tenant SaaS" |
| `create tables` | "create tables for a blog system" |
| `schema for` | "schema for inventory management" |
| `model data` | "model data for real-time analytics" |
| `I need a database` | "I need a database for tracking orders" |
| `design NoSQL` | "design NoSQL schema for product catalog" |

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Normalization** | Organizing data to reduce redundancy (1NF → 2NF → 3NF) |
| **3NF** | Third Normal Form - no transitive dependencies between columns |
| **OLTP** | Online Transaction Processing - write-heavy, needs normalization |
| **OLAP** | Online Analytical Processing - read-heavy, benefits from denormalization |
| **Foreign Key (FK)** | Column that references another table's primary key |
| **Index** | Data structure that speeds up queries (at cost of slower writes) |
| **Access Pattern** | How your app reads/writes data (queries, joins, filters) |
| **Denormalization** | Intentionally duplicating data to speed up reads |
