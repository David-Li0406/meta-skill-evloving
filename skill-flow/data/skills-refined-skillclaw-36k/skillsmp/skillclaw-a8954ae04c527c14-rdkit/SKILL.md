# RDKit Cheminformatics Toolkit

## Overview

RDKit is a comprehensive cheminformatics library providing Python APIs for molecular analysis and manipulation. This skill provides guidance for reading/writing molecular structures, calculating descriptors, fingerprinting, substructure searching, chemical reactions, 2D/3D coordinate generation, and molecular visualization. Use this skill for drug discovery, computational chemistry, and cheminformatics research tasks.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Molecular I/O and Creation

**Reading Molecules:**

Read molecular structures from various formats:

```python
from rdkit import Chem

# From SMILES strings
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('Cc1ccccc1')  # Returns Mol object or None

# From MOL files
mol = Chem.MolFromMolFile('path/to/file.mol')

# From MOL blocks (string data)
mol = Chem.MolFromMolBlock(mol_block_string)

# From InChI
mol = Chem.MolFromInchi('InChI=1S/C6H6/c1-2-4-6-5-3-1/h1-6H')
```

**Writing Molecules:**

Convert molecules to text representations:

```python
# To canonical SMILES
smiles = Chem.MolToSmiles(mol)

# To MOL block
mol_block = Chem.MolToMolBlock(mol)

# To InChI
inchi = Chem.MolToInchi(mol)
```

**Batch Processing:**

For processing multiple molecules, use Supplier/Writer objects:

```python
# Read SDF files
suppl = Chem.SDMolSupplier('molecules.sdf')
for mol in suppl:
    if mol is not None:  # Check for parsing errors
        # Process molecule
        pass

# Read SMILES files
suppl = Chem.SmilesMolSupplier('molecules.smi', titleLine=False)

# For large files or compressed data
with gzip.open('molecules.sdf.gz') as f:
    suppl = Chem.ForwardSDMolSupplier(f)
    for mol in suppl:
        # Process molecule
        pass

# Multithreaded processing for large datasets
suppl = Chem.MultithreadedSDMolSupplier('molecules.sdf')

# Write molecules to SDF
writer = Chem.SDWriter('output.sdf')
for mol in molecules:
    writer.write(mol)
writer.close()
```

**Important Notes:**
- All `MolFrom*` functions return `None` on failure with error messages.
- Always check for `None` before processing molecules.
