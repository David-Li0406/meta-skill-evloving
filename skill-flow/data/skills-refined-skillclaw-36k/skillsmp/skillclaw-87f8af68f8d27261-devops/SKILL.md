# DevOps Skill

Comprehensive guide for deploying and managing cloud infrastructure across Cloudflare edge platform, Docker containerization, and Google Cloud Platform.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deploying serverless applications to Cloudflare Workers
- Containerizing applications with Docker
- Managing Google Cloud infrastructure with gcloud CLI
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines across platforms
- Optimizing cloud infrastructure costs
- Implementing multi-region deployments
- Building edge-first architectures
- Managing container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Configuring cloud storage solutions (R2, Cloud Storage)
- Automating infrastructure with scripts and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Platform Selection Guide

### When to Use Cloudflare

**Best For:**
- Edge-first applications with global distribution
- Ultra-low latency requirements (<50ms)
- Static sites with serverless functions
- Zero egress cost scenarios (R2 storage)
- WebSocket/real-time applications (Durable Objects)
- AI/ML at the edge (Workers AI)

**Key Products:**
- Workers (serverless functions)
- R2 (object storage, S3-compatible)
- D1 (SQLite database with global replication)
- KV (key-value store)
- Pages (static hosting + functions)
- Durable Objects (stateful compute)
- Browser Rendering (headless browser automation)

**Cost Profile:** Pay-per-request, generous free tier, zero egress fees

### When to Use Docker

**Best For:**
- Local development consistency
- Microservices architectures
- Multi-language stack applications
- Traditional VPS/VM deployments
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD build environments
- Database containerization (dev/test)

**Key Capabilities:**
- Application isolation and portability
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Docker Compose for multi-container apps
- Volume management for data persistence
- Network configuration and service discovery
- Cross-platform compatibility
