# UMAP-Learn

## Overview

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique for visualization and general non-linear dimensionality reduction. Apply this skill for fast, scalable embeddings that preserve local and global structure, supervised learning, and clustering preprocessing.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install umap-learn
```

### Basic Usage

UMAP follows scikit-learn conventions and can be used as a drop-in replacement for t-SNE or PCA.

```python
import umap
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Prepare data (standardization is essential)
scaled_data = StandardScaler().fit_transform(data)

# Method 1: Single step (fit and transform)
embedding = umap.UMAP().fit_transform(scaled_data)

# Method 2: Separate steps (for reusing trained model)
reducer = umap.UMAP(random_state=42)
reducer.fit(scaled_data)
embedding = reducer.embedding_  # Access the trained embedding
```

**Critical preprocessing requirement:** Always standardize features to comparable scales before applying UMAP to ensure equal weighting across dimensions.

### Typical Workflow

```python
import umap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# 1. Preprocess data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(raw_data)

# 2. Create and fit UMAP
reducer = umap.UMAP(
    n_neighbors=15,
    min_dist=0.1,
    n_components=2,
    metric='euclidean',
    random_state=42
)
embedding = reducer.fit_transform(scaled_data)

# 3. Visualize
plt.scatter(embedding[:, 0], embedding[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='Spectral', s=5)
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('UMAP Embedding')
plt.show()
```

## Parameter Tuning Guide

UMAP has four primary parameters that control the embedding behavior. Understanding these is crucial for effective usage.

### n_neighbors (default: 15)

**Purpose:** Balances local versus global structure in the embedding.

**How it works:** Controls the size of the local neighborhood UMAP examines when learning manifold structure.

**Effects by value:**
- **Low values (2-5):** Emphasizes fine local detail but may fragment data into disconnected components.
- **Medium values (15-20):** Provides a balanced view of both local structure and global relationships.
- **High values (20+):** Captures more global structure but may lose local detail.
