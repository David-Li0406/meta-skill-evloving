# OpenTUI Platform Skill

Consolidated skill for building terminal user interfaces with OpenTUI. Use decision trees below to find the right framework and components, then load detailed references.

## Critical Rules

**Follow these rules in all OpenTUI code:**

1. **Use `create-tui` for new projects.** See framework `README.md` quick starts.
2. **`create-tui` options must come before arguments.** For example, `bunx create-tui -t react my-app` works, but `bunx create-tui my-app -t react` does NOT.
3. **Never call `process.exit()` directly.** Use `renderer.destroy()` (see `core/gotchas.md`).
4. **Text styling requires nested tags in React/Solid.** Use modifier elements, not props (see `components/text-display.md`).

## How to Use This Skill

### Reference File Structure

Framework references follow a 5-file pattern. Cross-cutting concepts are single-file guides.

Each framework in `./references/<framework>/` contains:

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `README.md` | Overview, when to use, quick start | **Always read first** |
| `api.md` | Runtime API, components, hooks | Writing code |
| `configuration.md` | Setup, tsconfig, bundling | Configuring a project |
| `patterns.md` | Common patterns, best practices | Implementation guidance |
| `gotchas.md` | Pitfalls, limitations, debugging | Troubleshooting |

Cross-cutting concepts in `./references/<concept>/` have `README.md` as the entry point.

### Reading Order

1. Start with `README.md` for your chosen framework.
2. Then read additional files relevant to your task:
   - Building components -> `api.md` + `components/<category>.md`
   - Setting up project -> `configuration.md`
   - Layout/positioning -> `layout/README.md`
   - Troubleshooting -> `gotchas.md` + `testing/README.md`

### Example Paths

```
./references/react/README.md           # Start here for React
./references/react/api.md              # React components and hooks
./references/solid/configuration.md    # Solid project setup
./references/components/inputs.md      # Input, Textarea, Select docs
./references/core/gotchas.md           # Core debugging tips
```

### Runtime Notes

OpenTUI runs on Bun and uses Zig for native builds. Read `./references/core/gotchas.md` for runtime requirements and build guidance.
