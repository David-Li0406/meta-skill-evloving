# Skill body

## Prerequisites

Before creating a PR, ensure all changes are committed. If there are uncommitted changes, run the `sentry-skills:commit` skill first to commit them properly.

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
```

If the output shows any uncommitted changes (modified, added, or untracked files that should be included), invoke the `sentry-skills:commit` skill before proceeding.

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Branch State

```bash
# Detect the default branch
BASE=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name')

# Check current branch and status
git status
git log $BASE..HEAD --oneline
```

Ensure:
- All changes are committed
- Branch is up to date with remote
- Changes are rebased on the base branch if needed

### Step 2: Analyze Changes

Review what will be included in the PR:

```bash
# See all commits that will be in the PR
git log $BASE..HEAD

# See the full diff
git diff $BASE...HEAD
```

Understand the scope and purpose of all changes before writing the description.

### Step 3: Write the PR Description

First, check if the repository has a PR template:

```bash
# Fetch PR template from GitHub
gh repo view --json pullRequestTemplates --jq '.pullRequestTemplates[0].body'
```

If a PR template exists, follow its structure and fill in all required sections. Otherwise, follow this structure:

```markdown
<brief description of what the PR does>

<why these changes are being made - the motivation>

<alternative approaches considered, if any>

<any additional context reviewers need>
```

**Do NOT include:**
- "Test plan" sections
- Checkbox lists of testing steps
- Redundant summaries of the diff

**Do include:**
- Clear explanation of what and why
- Links to relevant issues or tickets
- Context that isn't obvious from the code
- Notes on specific areas that need careful review

### Step 4: Create the PR

```bash
gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<description body here>
EOF
)"
```

**Title format** follows commit conventions:
- `feat(scope): Add new feature`
- `fix(scope): Fix the bug`
- `ref: Refactor something`

### Step 5: Add Reviewers (if known)

```bash
# Request review from specific people
gh pr edit --add-reviewer username1,username2

# Or request from a team
gh pr edit --add-reviewer @getsentry/team-name
```

Limit to 1-3 reviewers to maintain clear ownership.
